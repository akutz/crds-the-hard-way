# CRDs the hard way

A lot of people use Kubernetes these days, and just as many people, as well as organizations, rely on Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRD) as the basis of a project's application programming interface (API) layer. However, working with CRDs is often abstracted away by tooling such as Client-Go, Controller-Runtime, and Controller-Tools. While these are amazing projects, this repository aims to teach readers how CRDs work with manual, hands-on experience without any frameworks getting between you and the CRDs.
